# Newsletter and Communication Policy
**Decision Date**: December 28, 2025  
**Current Status**: **PAUSED** (Institutional Freeze)  

---

## 1. Executive Decision (Step 0)
As of December 28, 2025, the "Decision Ledger" (Email Newsletter) feature has been formally **PAUSED**. 

### Rationale:
- **Governance Alignment**: Capturing industrial user data without a finalized, legally-vetted privacy framework on local nodes creates institutional liability.
- **Non-Advisory Integrity**: To prevent any unintentional drift into "Market Alerts" or "Advisory Insights," the automated communication layer must remain inactive until the "Axiomatic Instrument" thesis is fully certified by external auditors.
- **Liability Mitigation**: By disabling email capture, we ensure zero PII (Personally Identifiable Information) storage in the current version.

## 2. Policy for Future Activation
Should the communication layer be reactivated, the following constraints are non-negotiable:

### Purpose (Permitted)
- **Technical Monographs**: Distribution of research papers on market physics and grid stability.
- **System Updates**: Notifications of engine version upgrades (e.g., from v2.6.4 to v2.7.0).
- **Assumptions Alerts**: General notifications that IEX volatility constants have been updated in the global registry.

### Explicit Prohibitions (Forbidden)
- **NO Advisory Alerts**: No "Buy Now" or "Load Shift Recommended" messages.
- **NO Personalized Prediction**: No emails claiming to predict a specific user's future bill.
- **NO AI-Generated Advice**: All communications must be human-authored and reviewed for engineering neutrality.

## 3. Data Storage (Future Model)
If activated, email storage must implement:
- **Local Isolation**: Emails stored on the sovereign node only.
- **Encryption-at-Rest**: AES-256 encryption.
- **Right to Erasure**: A deterministic "Unsubscribe & Purge" mechanism.

**Status Note**: The UI element for the newsletter has been updated to reflect this pause. No email data is currently being collected or persisted.
